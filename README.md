# TimeAdaptiveQNWR

Used to create efficiency studies for the time adaptive QNWR in preCICE on two coupled heat equations. The individual solvers can be run from the preCICE folder. To do this eitherrunning bash script in the Neumann and Dirichlet file to run the simulation with preCICe or run the command python3 heatCoupling.py -relax -Tol {tol} -which {case} to run the relaxation algorithm from https://github.com/PeterMeisrimel/DNWR.
